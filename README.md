This is a simple library to provides the connection between a Unix based system and the Arduino platform.

Always remember to open the arduino serial monitor and change the serial-port path in the test.cpp file before compiling or the connection will be impossible.



It uses the "termios.h" library, you can find information about It on this link: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html
